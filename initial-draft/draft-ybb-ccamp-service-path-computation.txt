1.  Introduction

   For transport technology, the service's path is hierarchical,
   including OTN-layer trails and WDM-layer trails.  According to the
   funcational structure defined by ITU-T, the OTN-layer trails include
   lower-order ODUk, high-order ODUk and OTUk trails.  The WDM-lay
   trails include OTS, OMS and OCh trail.  These trails and the
   configuration of client-side port configuration form an end-to-end
   client signal service.

   Path computation is a common network management funcation.  For
   traditional transport services, OTS and OMS trails are automatically
   generated once the fibers are connected and they don't require any
   path computation.  The path computation is performed on the OCh layer
   trails and above.  Traditionally, the path computation is performed
   from OCh to low-order ODUk trail layer by layer.  This is called
   bottom-up approach.

   One disavantage of bottom-up approach is that the client and server
   need to interact with each other multiple times.  And sometimes, the
   client layer trail cannot be computed until the server layer trail is
   setup.  This doea not comply with the intention of path computation
   which will not introduce actual configuration on the network.

   In addition, the client prefers to transfer intent-based
   configuration instead of complex network configuration to achieve
   path computation and obtain all the layers' path computation result
   at one time.  The server, usually it is played by the domain
   controller, can help to deal with the complex network configuration
   computation.  This is called top-down approach.

   This document focuses on the top-down path computation for
   transparent client signal service and non-transparent client signal
   service (Ethernet service).

   We also focus on addressing some undiscussed requirements, such as
   how to ultize a generic structure to display path information for all
   the layers' path at once, and how to specify some parameters on the
   server layer's trail in the service path computation request, and how
   to support more complex path constraints, and how to manage the path
   computation results and how to reference them in service provisioning
   request.

1.1.  Terminology and Notations

   The following terms are defined in [RFC7950] and are not redefined
   here:

   *  client

   *  server

   *  augment

   *  data model

   *  data node

   The terminology for describing YANG data models is found in
   [RFC7950].

1.2.  Tree Diagram

   A simplified graphical representation of the data model is used in
   Section 4 of this document.  The meaning of the symbols in this
   diagram is defined in [RFC8340].

1.3.  Prefix in Data Node Names

   In this document, names of data nodes and other data model objects
   are prefixed using the standard prefix associated with the
   corresponding YANG imported modules, as shown in the following table.

     +=============+====================================+===========+
     | Prefix      | Yang Module                        | Reference |
     +=============+====================================+===========+
     | clnt-svc    | ietf-trans-client-service          | [RFCYYYY] |
     +-------------+------------------------------------+-----------+
     | clnt-svc-pc | ietf-trans-client-path-computation | RFC XXXX  |
     +-------------+------------------------------------+-----------+

   RFC Editor Note: Please replace XXXX with the number assigned to the
   RFC once this draft becomes an RFC.  Please replace YYYY with the RFC
   numbers assigned to [I-D.ietf-ccamp-client-signal-yang].  Please
   remove this note.

2.  End to End Management of Transport Network Client Signal Service

   The hierarchical relationship of transport client signal service can
   reference to Figure 1: (Please note that, the OTN tunnels in this
   figure and subsequent figures include lower order OTN tunnels, higher
   order OTN tunnels, and OTU tunnels.  The supporting relationship
   should comply with ITU-T G.XXXX definition.  WDM tunnel also include
   the WDM, flexi-grid scenario and Media channel scenario.  The
   hierarchical relationship should comply with ITU-T G.XXXX
   definition.)

   |<----------Transparent client signal---------->|
        |<--------------OTN Tunnel---------->|
          |<------------WDM Tunnel-------->|

     Figure 1: Transparent Client Signal Service and its Server tunnel

   For Ethernet client signal service, the client signal can be
   encapsulated into multiple approach.  For example, it can be
   encapsulated into OTN tunnel directly, or it can be encapsulated into
   MPLS-TP/SDH tunnels and then into OTN tunnels.  Note that the SDH
   tunnel is considered as an outdated technology and lacks
   standardization.  Therefore, the scenario where Ethernet client
   signals are encapsulated into the SDH tunnel is not described in this
   document.  The Figure 2 shows the hierarchical relationship of
   Ethernet service:

   |<----------Ethernet client signal---------->|
      |<----MPLS-TP Tunnel (Optional) ----->|
       |<-----------OTN Tunnel----------->|
         |<---------WDM Tunnel--------->|

       Figure 2: Ethernet Client Signal Service and its Server tunnel

   The reference method is defined in the
   [I-D.ietf-ccamp-client-signal-yang].  The supporting relationship
   between the tunnels can be also found by the dependency-tunnel
   structure define by the [I-D.ietf-teas-yang-te].

3.  Requirements for Service Path Computation

3.1.  Top-down Approach

   For the Top-down approach, the path computation request should be
   based on client signal service.  It is needed to specify the source
   and destination access port of in the request.  In addition, some
   common parameters, such as number of path to be calculated,
   protection and restoration capabities, path computation policy and
   path constraint (see Section 3.3).etc.  The path computation result
   should contain all the layers' path information.  For the OTN tunnel
   and WDM tunnel, it can be existing

3.2.  Multi-layer Path Display

3.3.  Path Constraint

3.4.  Path Management
