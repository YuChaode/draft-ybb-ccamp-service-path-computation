And what about OTSiA?\r\n\r\n   We may consider the terms defined in other IETF drafts, such as OTN Tunnel, WDM Tunnel, OMS MCG and OTS MCG\r\n\r\n2) I would describe the top-down and bottom-up approaches in terms of path setup rather than in terms of path computation\r\n\r\n   IMHO, with bottom-up, there is no need for path computation in the client signal while this is required for the top-down approach\r\n\r\n3) I would avoid the term 'disadvantage' when talking about bottom-up\r\n\r\n   The bottom-up approach is more suitable in cases where the server layer tunnel is setup based on some planning of capacity to be provided in the client layer or when the multi-laye path computation or the decision of which tunnel to setup to support a client service is performed by the client controller.\r\n\r\n   A top-down approach is more suitable for the cases where the multi-layer path computation or the decision of which tunnel to setup to support a client service is delegated to the server controller.\r\n\r\n   Please note also that the YANG datastore architecture is design to support multiple interactions between the client and server controllers: we can further talk about this point offline\r\n\r\n4) I would say that the figures in the section on end-to-end management, are just examples\r\n\r\n   We can have scenarios where the transparent client signal is carried over a WDM tunnel (without an intermediate OTN tunnel).\r\n\r\n   I do not know how likely it this case but nothing precludes to configure a transparent clietn signal over an OTN network with only grey interfaces: in this case, there are no WDM tunnels underneath the OTN tunnel.\r\n\r\n   There can also be cases where a lower-order OTN tunnel is relying on a server-layer higher-order OTN tunnel.\r\n\r\n5) I would be careful when using the term 'transport' in IETF which can have multiple meanings.\r\n\r\n   We should try to use the term 'transport network' to avoid any ambiguity",
